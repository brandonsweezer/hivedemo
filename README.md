# Hive Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

Ensure you have nodejs, npm (or yarn), and nvm installed. I developed this demo in node version 14, so please use that version when running the app.

### `nvm install 14`
### `nvm use 14`

First git clone this repository into a directory of your choice.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm start`

The app should open a browser window to localhost:3000. If it doesn't, navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to view the demo.
